Overview

The game - titled "The Golden Age of Television" - is a flashcard game aimed at testing the current television show knowledge of the user. As the number and quality of great shows released continues to increase, more and more people find themselves being sucked into the binge watching culture.

The questions are about the top ranked and widely watched shows over multiple cable and internet streaming platforms.


Technology Used - JavaScript

JavaScript was used to activate both the input fields where users insert their typed answers, as well as the submit button that enters their answer into the system. After submit has been clicked, it is determined whether the user entered the correct answer according to the answer list. If it is correct, then the user sees an alert, informing them that they have answered right and should move on to the next card. After this, the user is no longer able to submit an answer into the system as it has disabled the 'submit' button. If the user answers the question incorrectly based on the answer key, then the alert will let them know that they have gotten it wrong and should try again.

Things to improve:
- Let the player push 'enter/return' key to activate the submit button
- Change Alert pop-ups to HTML, styled pop ups
- Vastly improve title style
- Have card turn into an image when the question has been correctly answered
